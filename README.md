# Botanophobia
A less scary game of Phasmophobia but with similar concepts.

You are a Botanist who specialises in the removal of weeds from people's backyards; however, these weeds are pesky.
You must identify:
* Where the weed is
* What type of weed it is


You then must take care of the weed before it takes over the whole backyard
